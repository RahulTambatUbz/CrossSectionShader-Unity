![Cross-Section Shader Example](path/to/your/example/image.png)

## Overview

The **Cross-Section Shader** for Unity is a versatile tool designed to visualize cross-sections of 3D models. Created using Unity's Shader Graph, this shader clips objects along a defined plane, revealing their internal structures. It's perfect for applications in games, education, and visualization, providing a powerful way to explore complex models interactively.

## Features

- **Dynamic Plane Detection:** The shader detects the plane's normal and position, allowing for real-time adjustments.
- **Material Clipping:** Enables the clipping of specified materials, revealing internal details of the 3D objects.
- **Customizable Properties:** Easily adjust the plane's position and normal vector to control the cross-section.
